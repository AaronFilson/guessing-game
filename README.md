This program runs a simple guessing game with feedback. It has three questions, including individual question feedback. The game can be re-run by reloading the index.html webpage.

  There is limited error correction for user input. At the end the user is presented with a summary and rewarded with cat pictures.

  To run this program, use a HTML5 and JavaScript 5 compliant web browser to open index.html.

  Enjoy!
